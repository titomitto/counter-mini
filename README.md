# Counter Mini

Counter Mini is a simple Flutter application designed to help developers learn
and implement **Clean Architecture** principles using **BDD**, **TDD**, and
**Riverpod** for state management. This project showcases a well-structured,
scalable codebase with a focus on testing and best practices in Flutter app
development.

## Features:

- Increment and decrement the counter with customizable values
- Set maximum and minimum limits for the counter
- Reset the counter with confirmation
- View a history of all counter changes
- Built-in validation to prevent setting invalid limits

## Key Learning Objectives:

- **Clean Architecture**: Layered structure for better separation of concerns
  and code organization
- **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)**: Gherkin-based feature files for
  defining app behavior
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Extensive unit, widget, and integration
  tests
- **State Management with Riverpod**: Efficient and reactive state handling

## Tech Stack:

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **Riverpod**: State management for scalable and maintainable apps
- **Gherkin**: For writing BDD scenarios
- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests to ensure
  app quality

This repository serves as a practical reference for developers looking to
implement clean architecture in Flutter apps with an emphasis on robust testing
practices and structured development workflows.
